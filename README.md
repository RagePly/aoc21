# Advent Of Code 2021
This is my repository for this year's **AoC**! All solutions will be written in **Rust** and I will be incrementally building a algorithm-library as I go. 
## Running the application
In order to reduce compilation-time while still gathering all solutions in the same crate I'm making use of conditional compilation. Each day has a corresponding *feature*
that control's wether the solution is compiled or not. The feature can be enabled by either editing the `default = [day#]` to the desired day in the `Cargo.toml` file or
specifying the features when building the application: `cargo build --feature day#`. The `all` feature compiles all days.

## Benchmark
Result of running `cargo run --release --features complete --features benchmark`
